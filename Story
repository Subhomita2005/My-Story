Once upon a time, there was a small but beautiful village near Rameshwaram. A small girl named Bholi was born in a family with 2 elder brothers.
She was a very innocent and didn,t know much about what's happening around the world. Her father thought that she has mental problem as she 
didn't react to any serious situations. Her father thought no one would marry her daughter as she grows up.
