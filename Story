Once upon a time, there was a small but beautiful village near Rameshwaram. A small girl named Bholi was born in a family with 2 elder brothers.
She was a very innocent and didn,t know much about what's happening around the world. Her father thought that she has mental problem as she 
didn't react to any serious situations. Her father thought no one would marry her daughter as she grows up.

One day the Sarpanch of the village took a decision to open up an all girl's school. The Sarpanch wanted few girls to start the school but still
could'nt find more than 2. He then requested Bholi's father as Bholi was at a age where she needed eduction. Her father agreed and bought some new 
clothes for her to attend the school.
